## Ex00: Conversion of scalar types

### What is a scalar type ? 
A scalar type holds a single value of a defined range. In this exercice we focus on four types : char, int, double, float. They can only store one value (a number or a character). The memory size depends on the architecture but these is the standard value in a 64-bits computer : 

| type | bytes |
| char | 1 byte |
| int | 4 bytes |
| float | 4 bytes |
| double | 8 bytes |
